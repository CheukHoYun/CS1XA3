# CS1XA3

(2023.11.15) This is an old repo for hosting the assignments when I took CS1XA3 at McMaster University back in 2017. I was new to programming at the time but some of the work in this assignment was actually pretty elaborated with a certain amount of complexity. Therefore instead of deleting the repo as I've done with most of my university course repos, I'm keeping this one and adding this README to illustrate what's included in each of the assignment.s 

## Assignment 1:
A bash script that grabs info from the course website (which is sadly living no more), processes them and allows some basic level of interaction.

## Assignment 2:
A Flappy Bird game copy made solely using Elm, a purely functional language. The game is playable [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CheukHoYun/CS1XA3/blob/master/Assign2/Assignment.html). Without even knowing what a state machine was, I crafted this little piece of game with no loops or mutable variables. Kudos to my 2017 self. 

## Assignment 3:
A Haskell math library that can take in math expressions, parse them into custom data types, perform arithmetic computations and return evaluated data. Again, I don't know why McMaster had this obsession with Functional Programming, but to be fair, it was pretty eye-opening and challenging for the first-year me. And I had fun.
